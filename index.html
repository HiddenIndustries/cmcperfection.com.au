								<p><blockquote>Corinne Culbert worked for Everingham Solomons initially as an administrator in the Business department and then as a contractor from CMC Perfection. Corinne was always an efficient and friendly person and we would not hesitate to employ Corinne’s services through CMC Perfection should the need arise.</blockquote><strong>MONICA BROOKS, Everingham Solomons Solicitors Tamworth</strong></p>
								<p><blockquote>Corinne Culbert has been working as my Virtual Assistant since 2011. I didn’t need a full-time Personal Assistant for my plumbing business but definitely needed someone on stand-by to prepare the odd quote and invoice for me. It was so easy. All I had to do was send a text message through to CMC Perfection and knew that my request was already under control. My business was based in Sydney and Corinne was based in Tamworth. This never was a problem. She managed to handle all my affairs for my accountants who were also based in Sydney. The distance was never an issue. I simply posted her all my receipts and she handled the rest. In my view, there is no better way to go. When running a small business to keep overheads down, hire CMC Perfection as your Virtual Assistant today. I recommend them highly!</blockquote><strong>JOHNNY VASILJ, NSW Plumbcorp</strong></p>
								<p><blockquote>I don’t need a full-time Personal Assistant. Having CMC Perfection just a phone call away to offer the assistance I need when I need it is great! I recommend CMC Perfection if you after a Personal Assistant for as little or as much time as you need and to be on-call for when it suits you the most.</blockquote><strong>MARK SIPPLE, Mark Sipple Plastering</strong></p>
								<p><blockquote>When I decided to start up my own cleaning business in September 2015 I bought a new computer. At that point, I wasn’t really sure where to start. I contacted CMC Perfection for some guidance. At that point, it was clear that I would simply hand over my new computer to CMC Perfection and let them set it up for me. My emails were set-up and all my necessary documents were created as templates. As well as my computer being set-up, I was provided clear instructions and given everything on a USB for back-up. If you are starting your own business and need support to do so and a business that you can trust, don’t hesitate to contact CMC Perfection.</blockquote><strong>JUDITH SEACH, Rose’s Commercial Cleaning</strong></p>
								<p><blockquote>I started my own business in May 2016. I really wasn’t sure where to start when it came to being prepared for invoicing my clients and keeping track of all of my paperwork for my accountants. CMC Perfection offered me the assistance I needed. They prepared all the necessary templates for me to enable me to run my business smoothly and document everything required. I recommend CMC Perfection for getting your business started as well as offering ongoing support when required.</blockquote><strong>CAMERON THOMAS, Sole Trader</strong></p>
								<p><blockquote>Corinne Culbert worked part-time with Fencing Australia from 2012 to 2014. When we realised that she had commenced her own business working as a consultant Personal Assistant, we booked CMC Perfection in straight away. CMC Perfection is a flexible way to have office support. In most cases, there is often no need to have a full-time staff member. You can simply cater to the requirements of your workplace week to week. CMC Perfection is always accommodating and happy to assist whenever possible. We definitely recommend CMC Perfection for your Personal Assistant needs. Whether you need support in the office or as a virtual assistant, don’t hesitate to call CMC Perfection.</blockquote><strong>CHRIS POWER, Fencing Australia Pty Limited</strong></p>
								<p><blockquote>I have known Corinne Culbert since the commencement of her career as a Personal Assistant back in 1996. Since that time, Ms. Culbert has been offering my business support whenever I have needed it. I don’t need a full-time PA and as a result being able to have CMC Perfection on-call for when my business needs her most is wonderful. I recommend CMC Perfection highly. There is no pressure or lock-in contracts. Help when needed is literally a phone call away.</blockquote><strong>JOHNNY CICUTO, Johnny’s Automotive Workshop</strong></p>

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is Corinne M. Culbert. I started CMC Perfection in 2014.</br>
 I was looking for an opportunity to have a flexible work life so as to ensure that I was able to also enjoy being a Mum.</br>
As a result, I took a leap of faith and resigned from my full-time job in 2015. Quickly it became apparent that this was the best decision I had made.</br>
Every day not only became different and exciting but enabled me to work the hours that suited me.</br>
I realised that there is such a desire for everyone to have a Personal or Virtual Assistant however to most, it seemed unachievable and financially unviable.</br>
With the chance to secure your very own Personal or Virtual Assistant for as many or as little time as you need this appealed to so many people. From having someone by your side or to being just a phone call away, whatever you need it is possible.</br>
Let me do what I love doing the most and organise your life like you never thought possible.</br>
Allow me to create the gift of time for you and get your life sorted! Call me today to lock in the support you want and need. I look forward to hearing from you.</br>
</br>
Warm regards,</br></br>
